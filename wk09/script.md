“You’ll complete 4 tasks with a task manager. I’ll time you and take notes. Think aloud - say what you’re thinking (‘Where’s the Edit button?’, ‘This is confusing’). There are no wrong answers - we’re testing the interface, not you. You can stop anytime.”



    Read scenario aloud from tasks.md
    Start timer when participant begins
    Observe (note clicks, hesitations, comments)
    Stop timer when task complete OR participant gives up
    Ask confidence: “On a scale 1-5, how confident are you that you completed correctly?”
    Record: Time, success (1/0), errors, confidence, notes

“Thanks! Any final thoughts? What was most confusing? What worked well?”
