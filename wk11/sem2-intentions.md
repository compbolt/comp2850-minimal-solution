# Semester 2 Intentions (Optional but useful)

## What we’ll carry forward
- Components and patterns we’ll reuse (Pebble partials, HTMX wiring).

## Risks to tackle early
- E.g., focus management in complex flows, state/history in multi-step edits.

## Guest lectures / project slots we want to see
- (ideas will be added to the team board)
