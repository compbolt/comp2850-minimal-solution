# Week 11 • Lab 1
### Present evidence · Gather critique · Plan next steps

- Showcase inclusive redesign
- Anchor story in metrics + accessibility proofs
- Practice giving & receiving critiques

---

## Goals today
- Demo no-JS and HTMX paths live
- Present before/after metrics + evidence
- Prove accessibility (SR, keyboard, checklist)
- Capture actionable feedback for Sem 2

---

## Prep checklist
- App running (JS toggle handy)
- Task 2 bundle draft ready
- Metrics summaries (`analysis/summary.md`, `03-before-after-summary.md`)
- Regression checklist + evidence assets
- Feedback forms (`wk11/crit/peer-feedback.md`)

---

## Presentation structure (15 min)
1. Live demo (no-JS → HTMX)
2. Metrics & evidence (tables, screenshots)
3. Accessibility proof (SR transcript / keyboard flow)
4. Q&A + critique intake

---

## Evidence board example
- Problem statement + backlog ID
- Before/after metrics table
- Annotated screenshot with alt text
- Regression checklist excerpt (PASS rows)
- Link to parity script / checklist
- Outstanding risks & next steps

---

## Reviewer focus
- Clarity: Did evidence match the problem?
- Inclusion impact: Who benefits? Any gaps?
- Accessibility execution: Errors, status, focus
- Parity: Proof for JS-off vs HTMX
- Suggestion: one concrete improvement

---

## During critique
- Take notes (board.md) while feedback arrives
- Ask clarifying questions about inclusion impacts
- Stay respectful and specific when reviewing peers
- Mention supporting docs (e.g., checklists) in feedback

---

## After presenting
- Update `wk11/crit/board.md` with key takeaways
- Add reflection to `research/notes.md`
- Insert new backlog items if needed
- Share useful feedback with wider team

---

## Deliverables today
- Feedback forms completed for teams you reviewed
- Notes + backlog updates committed
- Clarity on priorities heading into wrap-up lab

---

## Looking ahead
- Lab 2: portfolio polish, wrap-up pack, submission check
- Semester 2: carry forward critiques + open risks
